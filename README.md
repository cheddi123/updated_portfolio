I have added some of my recent assigments to demosntrate various aspects of full-stack development. More of the assignments were geared towards front-end for now , but in the future, more will be back-end. There is a linked in image to click on my  index page to get more information about me. I used moment.js, firebase DB, bootstrap, jQuery in this updated portfilio. Check out the project 1 , which wwas my first group project.
