                <p> My name is Cheddi Charles. I am the oldest of five brothers. I was born from the beautiful island
                    of Grenada
                    located south of the Caribbean sea. Growing up was not easy because we have to work hard to get
                    what you want.
                </p>


                <p> Sports is one of my favorite hobbies. I play cricket, soccer and basketball whenever I get the
                    chance. I always
                    dream of playing for my country but I was not good enough. At a young age, I had a liking for
                    numbers and maths.
                    I was never really good at English and I do not like to write a lot even at this present time. I
                    used my math
                    skills to help me solve problems and went on to do my first degree in mathematics.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I am a high school math teacher and I am doing a full stack bootcamp at SMU. Outside of
                    work , I like going out
                    to the movies, road trips, and out door activities. One of things that keep driving me is that I
                    always think
                    about how to do the work faster and effective at the same time. I know its going to be hard but I
                    have faith
                    in God. With God all things are possible.
